Goal: Update the Superstore Insights Streamlit dashboard so that it uses a consistent, professional color scheme across all charts and KPIs. The palette must be applied globally and reused in Plotly charts and Streamlit theming.

Requirements
🎨 Color Palette

Sales (Primary): Blue #1f77b4

Profit (Positive): Green #2ca02c

Loss (Negative): Red #d62728

Secondary/Neutral: Gray #7f7f7f

Accent (Highlights): Teal #17becf

Background: Light Gray #f9f9f9

🖼 Streamlit Theming

In .streamlit/config.toml, set:

[theme]
primaryColor = "#1f77b4"
backgroundColor = "#f9f9f9"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#ffffff"
textColor = "#000000"
font = "sans serif"

📊 Plotly Visuals

Apply consistent colors when building charts with Plotly Express:

Sales-based charts → Blue

Profit-based charts → Green

Loss-focused (sub-category, discount impact) → Red

Geography or secondary comparisons → Teal/Gray

Use consistent axis/label formatting: currency as $12.6M, percentages as 11.6%.

Example:

import plotly.express as px

fig = px.bar(df, x="Category", y="Sales", color_discrete_sequence=["#1f77b4"])
st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)

📌 Sections to Apply Colors

KPIs (Top row):

GMV (blue), Profit (green), Margin % (teal), Orders (gray).

Charts:

Sales by Category → Blue

Monthly Sales Trend → Blue line

Profitability (Sub-Category Losses) → Red for negatives, Green for positives

Geography (States/Cities) → Teal

Shipping Mode → Neutral Gray with Profit in Green

What-If Discount Simulator:

Actual Profit (Blue), Scenario Profit (Green if ↑, Red if ↓).

Add a gradient text/narrative: “Healthy zone (green ≤10%) → Loss zone (red >20%).”

📐 Layout

Use wide layout (st.set_page_config(layout="wide"))

Add st.divider() between sections.

Keep spacing neat, headings consistent.

✅ Acceptance Criteria

Dashboard feels modular and clean.

Sales, profit, and loss are always visually distinct.

The What-If section clearly communicates risk/reward using green/red.

No random Plotly default colors — always use the defined palette.
