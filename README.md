The Churn Insights Dashboard runs as a **Streamlit web application** that integrates **data preprocessing, machine learning models, explainability, and ROI-focused retention planning**.

The app ingests the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset, preprocesses categorical and numerical features, trains and evaluates models with cross-validation, and surfaces insights in a **five-tab business-oriented interface**:

1. **Executive Summary** – KPIs and quick business impact snapshot  
2. **Segments & Drivers** – high-risk groups and churn drivers  
3. **Retention Planner** – scenario planning with ROI calculations  
4. **Details & Methods** – metrics, confusion matrix, ROC & PR curves  
5. **Data & Quality** – dataset overview and health checks

All metrics and ROI values are calculated based on **user-adjustable assumptions** (threshold, cost per contact, value saved). **Exports** are available for metrics, feature importance, and scored customers.
